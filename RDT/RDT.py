Reliable Data Transfer
Problem: Implement a simple stop-and-wait Reliable Data Transfer 2.2 protocol. A simulated data
        channel can be used for data transfer which has an associated packet loss probability
        as given in the baseline.py file. Implementation should cover sending data and
        displaying the received data, receiving ACK for successful transmission, and
        retransmission in case the packet is not received/ suitable ACK is not received. Print
        statements must be given as mentioned in the baseline.py file and the output must be
        documented in the report.
